Place your Spotify streaming history JSON files here.

## How to Get Your Data:

1. Go to https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/
2. Request your "Extended Streaming History" data
3. Wait for Spotify to email you (may take a few days)
4. Download and extract the ZIP file
5. Copy all the JSON files from the "Streaming_History_Audio" folder to this directory

## Required Files:

The app will look for files matching this pattern:
- Streaming_History_Audio_*.json

You may have files with different date ranges - that's fine! The app will load all matching files.

## Note:

Your personal data files are NOT included in the GitHub repository for privacy. 
Each user needs to add their own Spotify data files to use this dashboard.
